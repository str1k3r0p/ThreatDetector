## üìã **Overview**

The Enterprise Advanced Threat Detector is a comprehensive PowerShell-based security tool designed to detect and respond to various cybersecurity threats including cryptominers, ransomware, trojans, botnets, spyware, and more. It features advanced threat intelligence, real-time monitoring, and automated response capabilities.

## üöÄ **Features**

### üîç **Threat Detection Capabilities**
- **Cryptominers** (XMRig, CoinHive, etc.)
- **Ransomware** (WannaCry, LockBit, etc.)
- **Trojans** (Reverse shells, Meterpreter, etc.)
- **Botnets** (Zeus, Emotet, TrickBot, etc.)
- **Spyware** (Keyloggers, credential stealers, etc.)
- **Downloaders** (Payload droppers, installers, etc.)
- **Rootkits** (Hidden processes, kernel drivers, etc.)
- **Worms** (Network spreading malware)
- **Adware** (Browser hijackers, pop-ups)

### üõ°Ô∏è **Advanced Security Features**
- **AI-Powered Threat Scoring** - Calculates risk scores for detected threats
- **Real-time Threat Intelligence** - Daily malicious DNS records integration
- **Deep Memory Analysis** - Detects process injection and memory anomalies
- **Enhanced File Content Analysis** - Scans for malicious patterns and code
- **Registry Threat Detection** - Monitors startup locations and registry keys
- **Process Tree Analysis** - Traces parent-child process relationships
- **Behavioral Anomaly Detection** - Identifies unusual patterns and behaviors
- **Automated Response System** - Automatic quarantine and blocking
- **Comprehensive Reporting** - HTML and JSON reports with dashboard
- **Threat Correlation Engine** - Finds complex attack patterns

### üìä **Monitoring & Analytics**
- **Performance Monitoring** - CPU/Memory usage tracking
- **Adaptive Sleep** - Adjusts scan intervals based on system load
- **Detailed Logging** - Structured JSON logging with threat details
- **Event Log Integration** - Windows Event Log support
- **Dashboard Generation** - Real-time threat visualization

## üìÅ **Required Directories**

The tool creates these directories automatically:
- `C:\ThreatQuarantine\` - Quarantined files
- `C:\ThreatIntel\` - Threat intelligence data and logs

## üõ†Ô∏è **Installation & Setup**

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11 (or Windows Server)
- PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- Administrative privileges (recommended)

### Installation Steps
1. **Save the script** as `ThreatDetector.ps1`
2. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**
3. **Enable script execution** (if needed):
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
4. **Run the script**:
   ```powershell
   .\ThreatDetector.ps1
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration**

### Configuration File
The tool automatically creates a configuration file at:
```
C:\ThreatIntel\config.json
```

### Sample Configuration
```json
{
    "ScanInterval": 45,
    "MaxFileSize": 10485760,
    "EnableLogging": true,
    "EnableAlerts": true,
    "EnableQuarantine": true,
    "SuspiciousThreshold": 70,
    "Whitelist": [
        "8.8.8.8",
        "1.1.1.1"
    ]
}
```

## üìä **Usage**

### Running the Tool
```powershell
# Run with administrative privileges
.\ThreatDetector.ps1
```

### Output Files
- **Logs**: `C:\threat_detector.log`
- **Reports**: `C:\ThreatIntel\Threat_Report_*.html`
- **Dashboard**: `C:\ThreatIntel\dashboard_*.html`
- **Quarantined Files**: `C:\ThreatQuarantine\`

## üîí **Security Features**

### Threat Intelligence Integration
- **Daily Malicious DNS Records** - Automatically downloads and updates threat intelligence
- **Hash Database** - Maintains local database of known malicious file hashes
- **Threat Cache** - Stores frequently accessed threat data for faster lookups

### Protection Mechanisms
- **Whitelisting** - Excludes known safe IPs, processes, and files
- **Process Isolation** - Prevents false positives from legitimate software
- **Automated Quarantine** - Securely moves malicious files to quarantine
- **Network Blocking** - Blocks connections to known malicious IPs

## üìà **Monitoring**

### Performance Metrics
- CPU Usage: Monitored and displayed in logs
- Memory Usage: Monitored and adjusted dynamically
- Network Connections: All established connections analyzed
- Threat Detection Rate: Real-time threat counting

### Alert Levels
- **INFO** - General system information
- **WARNING** - Potential security issues
- **ALERT** - Confirmed threats detected
- **ERROR** - System errors or failures

## üìã **Sample Output**

```
2024-01-15 14:30:45 [ALERT] [Cryptominer - High - Score: 85%] Suspicious process detected: xmrig.exe (PID: 1234)
2024-01-15 14:30:45 [INFO] [General] Blocked malicious connection: xmrig.exe (PID: 1234) -> 192.168.1.100 (pool.minergate.com)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues
1. **Execution Policy Errors**:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

2. **Permission Issues**:
   - Run PowerShell as Administrator
   - Ensure proper file permissions on directories

3. **Network Connectivity**:
   - Verify internet connectivity
   - Check firewall settings for outbound connections

### Log Analysis
Check `C:\threat_detector.log` for detailed information about:
- Detection events
- System performance
- Configuration issues
- Error messages
